<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family <i class="taxonomy family">Sphyrnidae</i>, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a <a href="description.html/#cephalofoil">cephalofoil</a>. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus <i class="taxonomy genus">Sphyrna</i>, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, <i class="taxonomy genus">Eusphyra</i>. Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near <span class="location specific">Malpelo Island</span> in <span class="location country">Colombia</span>, <span class="location specific">Cocos Island</span> off <span class="location country">Costa Rica, and near <span class="location specific">Molokai</span> in <span class="location country">Hawaii</span>. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern <span class="location continent">Africa</span>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The known species range from 0.9 to 6.0 <abbr aria-label="meters">m</abbr> (3.0 to 19.7 <abbr aria-label="feet">ft</abbr>) in length and weigh from 3 to 580 <abbr aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr> (6.6 to 1,278.7 <abbr aria-label="pounds">lb</abbr>). They are usually light gray and have a greenish tint. Their bellies are white which allows them to blend into the ocean when viewed from the bottom and sneak up on their prey. Their heads have lateral projections which give them a hammer-like shape.</p>
	<p>Hammerheads have disproportionately small mouths and seem to do a lot of bottom-hunting. They are also known to form schools during the day, sometimes in groups of over 100. In the evening, like other sharks, they become solitary hunters. National Geographic explains that hammerheads can be found in warm tropical waters, but during the summer, hammerheads participate in a mass migration to search for cooler waters.</p>

	<h3>Cephalofoil</h3>
	<p>The theory has been advanced that the hammer-like shape of the head may have evolved (at least in part) to enhance the animal's vision. The positioning of the eyes, mounted on the sides of the shark's distinctive hammer head, allows 360 degrees of vision in the vertical plane, meaning the animals can see above and below them at all times. The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food, aiding in close-quarters maneuverability and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability. However, it has been found that the unusual structure of its vertebrae was instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift. From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the hammer-head apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function. Like all sharks, hammerheads have electroreceptory sensory pores called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullae_of_Lorenzini" target="_blank">ampullae of Lorenzini</a>. The pores on the shark's head lead to sensory tubes, which detect electricity given off by other living creatures. By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy and Evolution</h2>
	<p>Since sharks do not have mineralized bones and rarely fossilize, their teeth alone are commonly found as fossils. The hammerheads seem closely related to the carcharhinid sharks that evolved during the mid-Tertiary period. According to DNA studies, the ancestor of the hammerheads probably lived in the Miocene epoch about 20 million years ago.</p>
	<p>Using mitochondrial DNA, a phylogenetic tree of the hammerhead sharks showed the winghead shark as its most basal member. As the winghead shark has proportionately the largest "hammer" of the hammerhead sharks, this suggests that the first ancestral hammerhead sharks also had large hammers.</p>
