<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family <i class="taxonomy family">Sphyrnidae</i>, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus <i class="taxonomy genus">Sphyrna</i>, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, <i class="taxonomy genus">Eusphyra</i>. Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. <strong>Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night</strong>. Some of these schools can be found near <span class="location specific">Malpelo Island</span> in <span class="location country">Colombia</span>, <span class="location specific">Cocos Island</span> off <span class="location country">Costa Rica, and near <span class="location specific">Molokai</span> in <span class="location country">Hawaii</span>. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern <span class="location continent">Africa</span>.</p>
